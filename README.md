# IntroductiontoMachineLearning

This is a 6 hour introduction to machine learning spread across two three hour lectures. The goal of this short course is very specific: to give you enough of an overview, vocabulary, intuition, and literature threads that you can identify a machine learning problem when you see it and begin researching possible approaches. The goal is not to train you to execute a particular machine learning solution. There are far too many approaches available, they may not cover whatever problem you are facing in the wild, and the state of the art would be different in only a year or two. Instead, we will learn how to think about and classify problems into broad types, how to define and measure the effecacy of different solutions to that problem, common and subtle mistakes, and building a full pipeline from start to finish.

Software and Programming
Students are not expected to know any particular language or set of software. We will be demonstrating best practices as used in the Machine Learning for Social Science Lab at the Center for Peace and Security Studies, UCSD. In that lab, our software stack includes Python and R for data preparation and analysis. Medium to large scale data is managed through the Spark ecosystem. Deep learning, when required, is handled in Keras/Tensorflow.
